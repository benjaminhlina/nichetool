\usage{
extract_group_metrics(data = NULL, community_df = NULL, data_format = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a \code{matrix} produced by the function \code{groupMetricsML()} in the
package \url{{SIBER}}.}

\item{community_df}{a four column data frame. One of the columns has to be named
\code{community} and the data in the column will be \code{numerics} as a \code{character}
string(e.g., \verb{"1", "2", "3"}). This is the order of the community names
and will be used to join the actual community names to the correct data.
These are the same class and values required by the function, \code{createSiberObject()}
from \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SIBER}{{SIBER}}.
The second column will be the names of the groups that are needed to supply
required by the function, \code{createSiberObject()}
from \href{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SIBER}{{SIBER}}.
The third column contains the actual names of the communities
that the user is working with (e.g., \code{"region"}).}

\item{data_format}{a \code{character} string that decides whether the returned object is
in long or wide format. Default is \code{"long"}, with the alternative supplied being \code{"wide"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} containing four rows when \code{data_format} is set to its
default which is \code{long}. These four rows are the following, \code{community},
\code{the_name_of_the_communities}, \code{metric} and \code{post_est}.
}
\description{
Extract group metrics within each community from a matrix object
that is produced by \code{groupMetricsML()} function from \url{{SIBER}}. These metrics
are the following   the convex hull total area (TA), Standard Ellipse Area (SEA), and the
corresponding small sample size corrected version SEAc based on the maximum likelihood
estimates of the means and covariance matrices of each group.
